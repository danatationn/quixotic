for some reason unknown to us mortals, lazer and stable handle slider balls differently

in stable, if you have `sliderb` skinned, then `sliderb-spec` and `sliderb-nb` are both ignored

BUT in lazer, if you have `sliderb` skinned, both of them can be skinned

you might be saying ok and ?

Ok and in stable i did the cool trick of just skinning `sliderb-spec` for that minimalist beach slider

in lazer that does not work . You NEED `sliderb` skinned for it to also pick up on `sliderb-spec`, which stable does not agree with

so yeah. Two different versions
